Assessing fatalities requires an evaluation of the proportion of damaged buildings that suffer partial or total collapse, as well as the expected fatality rates for occupants inside those collapsed buildings. To support these modeling needs, we reviewed past studies on casualties, existing proposals for collapse and fatality rates, and detailed damage databases that characterize different collapse mechanisms. Based on this review, collapse and fatality rates are proposed relative to a baseline building class. These rates are further calibrated considering reported fatalities since 1950 and the average annual fatalities estimated by the Global Seismic Risk Model of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation. Results show that the probability of collapse tends to decrease with the number of stories, while fatality rates have the opposite trend. Furthermore, an open-access database of calibrated collapse and fatality rates is provided and can be used to assess fatalities due to earthquake scenarios or in probabilistic seismic risk analysis.","tags":["exposure modeling","global earthquake model"],"title":"Calibrating collapse and fatality rates for the assessment of fatalities due to earthquakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Prince Modi","Carmine Galasso","Jack Baker","Vitor Silva"],"categories":null,"content":"Interactive dashboard Explore trends related to property damage and displacement duration from the United States Household Pulse Survey at https://hps.nicolepaul.io/.\nExample figure Percentage of households displaced by state according to the United States Household Pulse Survey (based on all available survey datawhere displacement is included through July 2024).

These guarantees are often referred to as ACID properties:\nAtomic: All-or-nothing Consistent: The system must remain in a valid state before and after Isolated: Each transaction appears to run alone Durable: Changes persist despite failures Need for Distributed Transactions Large databases often contain millions of records and are sharded across machines (e.g., one shard contains rows A–N, another O–Z) to improve performance. When a transaction spans multiple shards, we need concurrency control and commit protocols to preserve ACID guarantees.\nSpanner addresses this by using Two-Phase Locking (2PL) and Two-Phase Commit (2PC).\nSpanner Architecture A Spanner deployment is called a universe. It is composed of multiple zones, each with:\nA zonemaster that assigns data to spanservers Between 100 and several thousand spanservers Each spanserver manages 100–1000 tablets, which are sharded partitions of tables based on primary keys.\nTo support replication, Spanner:\nImplements a Paxos state machine per tablet Replicates tablets across spanservers using Paxos groups Handles concurrency control via a lock table at the Paxos leader Uses a transaction manager to coordinate multi-tablet transactions TrueTime API Spanner relies on the TrueTime API to support external consistency and concurrency control.\nTrueTime returns an interval: TTinterval = [earliest, latest] TT.now() returns the interval during which the call occurred TT.after(t) returns true if t has definitely passed TT.before(t) returns true if t has definitely not yet occurred TrueTime uses GPS and atomic clocks, each with different failure modes. Each data center has time master machines, and each machine runs a timeslave daemon that polls these masters.\nIn production, the uncertainty bound ε (epsilon) is typically 1–7 ms, representing half the width of the TTinterval.\nTransactions in Spanner Read-Write Transactions Spanner uses Two-Phase Locking (2PL) and Two-Phase Commit (2PC) for distributed read-write transactions.\nThe coordinator gathers: Prepared timestamps from non-coordinators TTcommit, the commit time from the client It then chooses a commit timestamp that is: Greater than all prepared timestamps Greater than TTcommit.latest Greater than any earlier transaction timestamps Spanner performs a commit wait to ensure this timestamp is safely in the past before finalizing the commit.\nRead-Only Transactions If all required keys reside within a single Paxos group, the leader assigns the last committed write timestamp as the transaction timestamp, minimizing wait time. If keys span multiple Paxos groups, the timestamp is set to TT.now().latest, requiring a small delay until this time safely passes. Read-only transactions can be served from sufficiently up-to-date replicas, allowing for non-blocking and lock-free reads.\nSummary Spanner blends concepts from database and distributed systems research:\nFrom databases: SQL-like interface, relational schema, transactions From systems: Scalability, fault tolerance, sharding, replication, and global distribution Thanks to the TrueTime API, Spanner achieves strong guarantees around external consistency, lock-free read-only transactions, and non-blocking reads in the past—demonstrating that precise time semantics are practical and powerful in distributed systems.\n","date":1709596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709596800,"objectID":"aa92155676e7639f903c097fbfd92a6a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/google-spanner/","publishdate":"2024-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/google-spanner/","section":"post","summary":"*An overview of Google Spanner’s architecture, distributed transactions, and the TrueTime API, based on the paper by Corbett et al.*","tags":["distributed systems","databases","Google Spanner","research"],"title":"Exploring the Power of Google Spanner for Distributed Transaction Processing","type":"post"},{"authors":["Prince Modi","Carmine Galasso","Jack Baker"],"categories":null,"content":"Example figure Timeline representing displacement duration alongside key phases of disaster management and recovery.

In the forthcoming years, the annual number displaced is expected to increase, driven by poorly-managed urban growth in hazard-prone areas2 and potentially exacerbated by climate change3. Despite this scale of human impact, most disaster risk assessments focus on direct economic losses, a metric that often highlights the wealthiest as the most at-risk. However, the reality of disasters is that the poor are disproportionately affected4, and mitigations informed primarily by economic loss may deepen existing inequalities. This research proposes to quantify disaster-induced displacement; a more equitable risk metric to depict the human toll of disasters.\nKey definitions and the scope. The highlighted labels indicate the areas considered in this review. Labels below the highlighted labels are subsets of that category. Research themes The importance of duration Most statistics regarding population displacement following a disaster event provide single snapshot values, often representing a peak estimate during the emergency phase. However, the duration of displacement is essential for understanding the human impact. For example, large- scale displacement in the form of evacuations before a storm can save lives and be followed by mass return shortly afterward. In contrast, a devastating event such as an earthquake could damage or destroy a significant proportion of the residential building stock, causing occupants to seek alternative accommodations for months to years. Not only does this type of protracted displacement pose a significant disruption to the livelihoods of affected households (e.g., lost income, interrupted education), but the consequences can ripple out into the larger community (e.g., outmigration and urban blight, lost economic production). Therefore, a key objective of this research is to refine our understanding of household displacement duration in disasters.\nTimeline representing displacement duration alongside key phases of disaster management and recovery. Determinants of household return Disasters are life events that can subject households to key decision points, such as: whether to evacuate, where to seek shelter, whether to return/wait/relocate, and whether to stay or resettle. From a literature review of household return after disasters, the following categories of determinants have been identified.\nCategory Determinants of return Physical damage to the built environment Habitability of housing (damage, weather, utilities)Housing typeCommunity damageReconstruction progress Psychological \u0026amp; social phenomena Acceleration of ongoing trendsAttachment to placeSocial capital (networks, family and friends)Perceived risk Household demographics Socioeconomic status (e.g., income level)Housing and land tenureRace/ethnicity/casteAge Pre- and post-disaster policies Pre-existing housing conditions (e.g., vacancies)Housing reconstruction approachOther disaster assistance policies The role of housing damage For more on the role of housing damage in population displacement predictions, please refer to my open access paper Disaster literature offers a clear consensus that housing damage is a primary driver of household displacement of disasters, both for initial displacement and longer-term displacement. However, additional factors (e.g., place attachment and housing tenure) have more recently been proposed as highly influential for household return in the recovery phase. Despite the range of factors beyond damage that have been proposed to influence household return, standard practice in disaster risk analysis is to solely consider housing damage. That is, the number of destroyed homes is multiplied by the average household size to yield an estimate of the displaced population.\nAn illustration of the conventional practice for estimating population displacement after disaster events. I benchmarked predictions of household displacement based solely on housing damage to understand the extent to which such simplified models can explain the phenomenon. The scenario model estimates showed some promise to predict potential long-term housing needs. However, quantifying displacement duration remained a clear challenge as official reports lacked this information and model estimates similarly lacked a time component. Mobile location data could theoretically fill the data gap on duration, but the benchmarking results indicate that further investigation is required on such data-driven methods.\nBenchmarking results for displacement estimates using a scenario risk analysis that only considers housing damage (green) versus official reports and mobile location data-based estimates. The full results of the benchmarking study are available in a journal paper and a conference paper.\nPredicting displacement durations For more on …","date":1664150400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664150400,"objectID":"2320825263cfcd6dbeaf26dc1e53a2d4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/household-displacement/","publishdate":"2022-09-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/household-displacement/","section":"project","summary":"*Supervised by Prof. Carmine Galasso and Prof. Jack Baker*","tags":["household displacement"],"title":"Household displacement after disasters","type":"project"},{"authors":["Prince Modi","Vitor Silva","Desmond Admo-Oduro"],"categories":null,"content":"Example figure Estimated number of residential buildings in Africa, aggregated on a uniform hexagonal grid of 0.5 decimal degrees.

The high population growth and rapid pace of urbanization within many African countries entail a significant potential for increased economic and human losses, particularly where substantial urban growth encroaches upon hazard-prone regions with inadequate land management and building design regulations. This study introduces a new exposure model for all African countries using national and global datasets with a uniform approach across the continent, developed for a baseline year (2020) and six future years (2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050). The exposure model was originally derived with subnational statistics, and then further spatially disaggregated using Earth Observation (EO) data. This refined spatial resolution allows the model to reflect a realistic population distribution within each country and thereby better characterizes the potential risk to natural hazards and allows identification of disaster risk hotspots. The results indicate the current concentrations of building stock in Africa, in addition to regions where the urban building stock is expected to nearly triple (such as in Central and East Africa) or at least double (such as in West and South Africa).","tags":["exposure modeling","global earthquake model","africa"],"title":"Development of a uniform exposure model for the African continent for use in disaster risk assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jamal Dabbeek","Helen Crowley","Vitor Silva","Graeme Weatherill","Prince Modi","Cecilia Nievas"],"categories":null,"content":"Policy documents Prioritising EU regions for building renovation by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC), 2022 ","date":1628467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628467200,"objectID":"f741bbbab95b2b608c4ea6e537aa814d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/journal-article/2021-exposure-spatial-resolution/","publishdate":"2023-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2021-exposure-spatial-resolution/","section":"publication","summary":"The spatial resolution of exposure data has a substantial impact on the accuracy and reliability of seismic risk estimates.

Losses are examined in terms of portfolio average annual loss (AAL) and return period losses at national and sub-national levels. The results indicate that neglecting the uncertainty related to asset locations and their associated site conditions within an exposure model can introduce significant bias to the risk results.
