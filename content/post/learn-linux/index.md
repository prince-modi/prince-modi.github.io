## Introduction

This guide lays out a practical, hands-on approach to learning Linux, developed through personal experience since 2016. Whether you're new to Linux or want to solidify your command-line and system-level skills, this roadmap provides a progressive learning path—from fundamentals to intermediate scripting and system usage.

## Level 1: Core Linux Foundations

### 1. Understand What Linux Is

Before diving in, understand the nature of Linux as a kernel and as a family of distributions (Debian, Fedora, Arch, etc.).

- Learn how Linux powers servers, desktops, and embedded systems.
- Start with a user-friendly distro like Ubuntu or Fedora.

### 2. Get Comfortable with the Terminal

The terminal is central to Linux proficiency.

- Learn essential navigation: `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`
- Practice running commands and reading man pages: `man`, `--help`

### 3. File System and Permissions

Understand the Linux directory hierarchy and permission model:

- Filesystem layout: `/etc`, `/home`, `/usr`, etc.
- Permissions: `chmod`, `chown`, `umask`

### 4. Use a Text Editor

Get fluent with editors like `vim`, `nano`, or `micro`.

- Practice editing config files
- Learn how to save, quit, and use search/replace

## Level 2: Intermediate Concepts

### 1. File Redirection and Pipes

- Combine commands with `|`, `>`, `>>`, `<`
- Example: `cat file.txt | grep "search_term"`

### 2. User and Group Management

- Add users: `adduser`, `passwd`
- Create and manage groups: `groupadd`, `usermod`

### 3. Package Management

Learn to install and update software:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt`, `dpkg`
- Red Hat/Fedora: `dnf`, `rpm`
- Arch: `pacman`

### 4. Process and Job Control

- Monitor: `top`, `htop`, `ps`
- Kill: `kill`, `pkill`
- Backgrounding: `&`, `fg`, `bg`, `jobs`

---

## Level 3: Automation and Networking

### 1. Shell Scripting Basics

Write simple scripts to automate tasks.

- Use loops, conditions, and functions
- Example script: backup a directory, check uptime

### 2. Crontab and Scheduling

- Automate recurring tasks with `crontab -e`
- Understand syntax: `* * * * * /path/to/script.sh`

### 3. Networking Tools

- Inspect network settings: `ip`, `ifconfig`, `ss`
- Troubleshoot: `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`

## Tips and Final Thoughts

- Use Linux as your **daily driver** to build habits.
- **Break things**—it’s the fastest way to learn.
- Build projects: write a script, host a service, use SSH.
- Read source code and engage with communities (forums, GitHub, Stack Overflow).

> “The more you break, the more you learn. That’s how you grow with Linux.”
